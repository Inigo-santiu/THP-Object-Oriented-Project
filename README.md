This is the second object oriented program.

It is a series of "video games" with a design process oriented towards teaching the use and application of the "class" and "method" application in ruby.

These programs were put together after several hours by students David Beraud, Kevin Phim, and Daniel Stavroff, with consulting advice from another student, Juliet de Rozario.
